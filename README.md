# Project Name
> Problem statement: To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.
- What is the background of your project?
This project is to apply learning from CNN course. The goal is to use CNN to predict Melanoma tyep of skin cancer from images availabe in the dataset.

- What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve?
Problem statement: To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

- What is the dataset that is being used?
The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). All images were sorted according to the classification taken with ISIC, and all subsets were divided into the same number of images, with the exception of melanomas and moles, whose images are slightly dominant.

## Conclusions
- Class rebalancing has a significant effect on validation accuracy 
- Data IO optimisation stratagies become relevant with larger datasets 
- Right layering and Epochs have a big impact on model accuracy
- It was interesting to see that rotated imapges couyld be used to augment the dataset
